Description: 
    Tools for extracting word and phrase frequencies from the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) 
    database via the 'childesr' API. Supports type-level word counts, 
    token-mode searches with simple wildcard patterns and part-of-speech 
    filters, optional stemming, and Zipf-scaled frequencies. Provides 
    normalization per number of tokens or utterances, speaker-role 
    breakdowns, dataset summaries, and export to Excel workbooks for 
    reproducible child language research. 
    The CHILDES database is maintained at <https://talkbank.org/childes/>.
