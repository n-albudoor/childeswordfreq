Description: Provides tools to extract word frequencies from the CHILDES
    (Child Language Data Exchange System) corpus. The main function allows users
    to input a list of words and receive speaker-role-specific frequency counts
    and a summary of the dataset. The output includes Excel-formatted tables of
    word counts and metadata summaries such as number of speakers, transcripts,
    children, and token counts. Useful for researchers studying early language
    acquisition, corpus linguistics, and speaker role variation. The CHILDES
    database is maintained at <https://childes.talkbank.org/>.
